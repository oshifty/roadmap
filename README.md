# SHIFTY Roadmap
Tracking the global progress and next steps to bring SHIFTY to life ðŸš§

## Usage
Issues will automatically be displayed on the website in the Roadmap section and on the Roadmap page (todo: links). Closed issues will be marked as done - therefore delete non-relevant issues.

The Issue Body needs to contain a html comment spanning four lines to set the date and the order, for example:

```html
<--
date: November 2024
order: 3
-->
```

The rest of the body will be displayed as is.
